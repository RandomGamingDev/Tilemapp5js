# Tilemapp5js
A tilemap library for p5 js

To use the library simply create a new instance of the pixy class with the offset, size, resolution, image and tile list (they're all arrays with 2 elements, except for the last 2, with the 2nd last being an image and the last being a 2d array with each array of the main array having a length of 4) and then just change the Pixy.pixels array and execute Tilemap.display() in order to display!

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/Tilemapp5js/tilemap.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.
